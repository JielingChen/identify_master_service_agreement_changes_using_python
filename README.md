# Identify Master Service Agreement Updates Using Python

In this project, I used Python to developed a tool that can be used to identify the changes that have been made in an updated Master Service Agreement(MSA). It consists of 6 parts:
* 1. Web Scraping to Automatically Download the MSA Files From the Website
* 2. Extracting Text From PDF Files
* 3. Cleaning the Extraced Text Using Regular Expression
* 4. Using A Pre-trained NLP Model to Tokenize Text into Sentences
* 5. Comparing Two Files Sentence by Sentence
